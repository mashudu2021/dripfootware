architecture diagram following components:

Frontend: Handles the user interface and experience, displaying product listings, images, and navigation elements. This is often built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend: Manages business logic, user authentication, and interactions with the database. In this case, Django would serve as the backend framework.

Database: Stores product information, user data, and transaction records. Common choices include PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Media Storage: Holds images and other media files associated with products. This could be managed using cloud storage solutions or the hosting platform's storage.

Payment Gateway Integration: Facilitates secure payment processing, possibly integrating with services like PayPal or Stripe.

Hosting Platform: In this case, PythonAnywhere provides the infrastructure to deploy and run the application.
